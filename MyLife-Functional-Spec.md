# MyLife (Bishop) — Functional Specification

> **Purpose**: This document is the source of truth for the MyLife/Bishop application. It is written for developers, AI coding assistants, and power users. Each major section describes what a feature does and how it works. Shared features (photos, facts, activities, etc.) are described in depth in [Part 11: Shared Features](#part-11-shared-features) — individual sections above reference them and only expand on nuances.

## Part 1: Architecture & Infrastructure

### Firebase Project
- **Project ID**: `bishop-62d43`
- **Plan**: Spark (free tier) — no Firebase Storage, no Blaze upgrade required
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth, email/password only
- **Database**: Firestore in native mode
- **No server**: Static site + Firestore — zero backend cost

### Per-User Data Scoping
All Firestore reads and writes go through the `userCol(collectionName)` helper defined in `firebase-config.js`. It scopes all data under `/users/{uid}/{collection}`, so every user has a completely separate data namespace. **All JS modules use `userCol()` exclusively — no flat root-level collections exist.**

```js
// firebase-config.js
function userCol(collectionName) {
    return db.collection('users').doc(currentUid).collection(collectionName);
}
```

### Authentication (`auth.js`)
- Firebase Auth email/password
- On load: checks `auth.onAuthStateChanged` — if logged in, shows app; if not, shows login screen
- Login screen is a full-page overlay rendered before any app content
- `#changepassword` route allows password update
- No multi-user sharing or role-based access currently

### Routing (`app.js`)
- **Hash-based SPA routing**: All navigation uses `window.location.hash` (e.g., `#zone/abc123`, `#plant/xyz`)
- `hashchange` event triggers the router, which reads the hash and calls the appropriate load function
- 40+ unique routes across yard, house, life, and shared pages
- **No page reloads** — all navigation is client-side

### Modal System (`zones.js`)
- `openModal(id)` — shows a `<dialog>` or overlay div, calls `history.pushState({modal: id}, '')`
- `closeModal(id)` — hides the modal, calls `history.back()` asynchronously
- **Critical pattern**: Navigation after `closeModal()` must be wrapped in `setTimeout(..., 50)` to let `history.back()` resolve before a new hash is set, or the navigation will be lost
- `dataset.mode` and `dataset.editId` on modals distinguish add vs. edit

### Global State
Key entities being viewed are stored on `window` for cross-module access:
- `window.currentZone`, `window.currentPlant`, `window.currentWeed`, `window.currentChemical`
- `window.currentThing`, `window.currentSubThing`, `window.currentItem`
- `window.currentRoom`, `window.currentFloor`
- `window.currentVehicle`, `window.currentCollection`, `window.currentCollectionItem`
- `window.currentPerson`, `window.currentNotebook`
- `window.currentPlace`

### Stale Event Listener Pattern
Many modals and buttons are re-wired every time a page loads. To avoid accumulating duplicate listeners, the pattern is:
```js
var newBtn = btn.cloneNode(true);
btn.parentNode.replaceChild(newBtn, btn);
newBtn.addEventListener('click', handler);
```

### Cache Busting
All `<script>` and `<link>` tags in `index.html` have a `?v=N` version query string. When any JS or CSS file is changed, **all tags must be bumped** to the same new version number. The CSS `<link>` tag is easy to forget — it must also be bumped.

- Current pattern: `<script src="js/app.js?v=316"></script>`
- CSS: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css?v=316">`

### LLM Configuration (`settings.js`)
- Stored in `userCol('settings').doc('llm')` — behind auth, not in localStorage
- Fields: `provider` (openai / xai), `apiKey`, `model` (optional override)
- Default models: `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI), `grok-3` (xAI)
- Both use the OpenAI-compatible API format (`/v1/chat/completions`)

## Part 2: Yard

**Plan document**: `plan.md`

The Yard section tracks outdoor spaces, plants, weeds, chemicals, and maintenance activities. It is the original core of the app.

### Zones (`zones.js`)
Zones are the organizational backbone of the yard. They form a hierarchy up to 3 levels deep.

**Firestore**: `zones` — `name`, `parentId`, `level` (1/2/3), `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#home` (root zone list), `#zone/{id}` (zone detail)

**Hierarchy**:
- Level 1: Major zones (e.g., "Front Yard", "Back Yard", "Creek")
- Level 2: Sub-zones (e.g., "By Mailbox", "Behind Garage")
- Level 3: Detail zones (e.g., "Left Flower Bed")

**Features on each zone**:
- Child zones (add/edit/delete — deleting a zone with children is blocked)
- Plants in zone (list with "View All Plants" option — see Plants)
- [Shared] Facts, Problems, Quick Task List, Activities, Photos, Calendar Events
- Life Projects — rich project management (itineraries, bookings, packing, to-dos)

**Edit/Delete modal**: The zone detail page has an Edit button that opens a modal pre-filled with the zone name. The Delete button is inside this edit modal (not on the detail page directly) — it appears only in edit mode, not when adding a new zone.

**Zone reassignment**: Plants and sub-zones can be moved to a different parent zone via a modal picker that shows the full hierarchy with indentation.

### Plants (`plants.js`)
Each plant is an individual physical instance — 3 azalea bushes = 3 records. Plants are tied to a single zone.

**Firestore**: `plants` — `name`, `zoneId`, `metadata{}`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Metadata fields**: `heatTolerance`, `coldTolerance`, `sunShade`, `wateringNeeds`, `bloomMonth`, `dormantMonth` (all optional, set via dropdowns/pickers)

**Routes**: `#plant/{id}` (detail page)

**View All Plants**: From any zone, "View All Plants" shows a flat list of every plant in that zone and all sub-zones beneath it. Clicking a plant navigates to its detail page.

**Zone reassignment**: Modal picker with full zone hierarchy to move a plant.

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems, Quick Task List, Activities, Photos, Calendar Events — all available on plant detail.

### Weeds (`weeds.js`)
Weeds are tracked by type (not by zone instance). Each weed type stores its treatment and zone assignments.

**Firestore**: `weeds` — `name`, `treatmentMethod`, `applicationTiming`, `notes`, `zoneIds[]`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#weeds` (list), `#weed/{id}` (detail)

**Zone assignment**: Checkbox modal showing all zones with indentation. A weed type can be assigned to multiple zones.

**LLM Identification** (if LLM configured):
- User takes/uploads a photo of the weed
- Before calling the LLM, all existing weeds (ID + name) are fetched and appended to the prompt
- LLM returns `existingWeedId` in the JSON if the photo matches an existing weed in the collection
- **Duplicate detection**: if `existingWeedId` is returned, a confirm dialog asks "Would you like to go to that weed?" — Yes navigates to `#weed/{id}`; No returns to `#weeds`. No new record is created.
- If no duplicate: result shown in a review modal (all fields editable)
- On save: creates weed record + a Fact (reference URL) + saves photo(s)
- If LLM cannot identify: shows "Could Not Identify" modal — user can still save manually
- Duplicate check applies to both the normal flow and the "show response" review modal path

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems, Quick Task List, Activities, Photos, Calendar Events

### Chemicals / Products (`chemicals.js`)
A shared inventory of all chemicals, fertilizers, herbicides, and products used in the yard.

**Firestore**: `chemicals` — `name`, `notes`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#chemicals` (list), `#chemical/{id}` (detail)

**Used by**: Activities and Saved Actions link to chemicals via `chemicalIds[]` array. Multiple chemicals can be linked to a single activity.

**[Shared]**: Facts (URL values clickable as links), Photos

### Activities & Saved Actions (`activities.js`)
See [Shared: Activities](#activities) for the full description. Nuances in the Yard context:
- Activities can target zones, plants, or weeds (`targetType` = `zone`/`plant`/`weed`)
- Multi-chemical selection: checklist of all chemicals, any number can be linked
- Saved Actions: reusable templates to pre-fill activity description + chemical selection

### Yard "More" Section (`#home`)
The yard main page has a **More** section below the zone list containing two panel cards:
- **Open Problems** — shows count of open problems across zones, plants, and weeds; clicking navigates to `#yard-problems`
- **All Quick Tasks** — shows count of all quick tasks across zones, plants, and weeds; clicking navigates to `#yard-projects`

### Yard Problems Page (`projects.js`)
**Route**: `#yard-problems`

Lists all open problems (`status === 'open'`) across zones, plants, and weeds. Each card shows the problem description and a location label (for plants: "Zone › Plant Name"; for zones/weeds: the entity name). Clicking navigates to the owning entity's detail page.

**Breadcrumb**: Yard › Open Problems

### Yard Quick Tasks Page (`projects.js`)
**Route**: `#yard-projects`

Lists all quick tasks whose `targetType` is `zone`, `plant`, or `weed`. Each card is expandable and shows its title, target entity, and checklist.

**Breadcrumb**: Yard › All Quick Tasks

### Activity Reports (`activityreport.js`)
- **Route**: `#activityreport`
- Filter activities by date range, grouped by type and target entity
- Summary view of what was done and when across the entire yard

### Bulk Activity (`bulkactivity.js`)
- **Route**: `#bulkactivity`
- Log the same activity to multiple zones or plants in one action
- Avoids repetitive data entry for tasks done across many locations (e.g., "Watered everything")

---

## Part 3: House

**Plan document**: `HousePlan.md`

The House section tracks the interior of the home using a 4-level hierarchy: Floor → Room → Thing → Sub-Thing → Item.

**House page (`#house`)** shows: summary stats bar (upcoming calendar events only), **Open Problems** single panel card (shows count; clicking navigates to `#house-problems`), Floors section (clickable cards), a static **More** section with icon cards linking to Garage (`#garage`), Vehicles (`#vehicles`), and Collections (`#collections`), an Upcoming calendar rollup, and a Breaker Panels section. Garage, Vehicles, and Collections are no longer on the main landing page — they live under House → More. Room count removed from stats bar (visible per-floor already). The **events stat chip** (e.g. "1 upcoming calendar event") is a clickable link to `#house-calendar-events`.

**House Quick Tasks page (`#house-projects`)**: Lists all quick tasks from floors, rooms, and things. Each card shows the task title and location path. Clicking navigates to the owning entity. Breadcrumb: House › All Quick Tasks.

**House Problems page (`#house-problems`)**: Lists all open problems from floors, rooms, and things. Each card shows the problem description and a location path (Floor › Room › Thing). Clicking a card navigates to the owning entity. Breadcrumb: House › Open Problems.

**House Calendar Events page (`#house-calendar-events`)**: Lists all calendar events tied to house entities (floor, room, thing, subthing, item). Shows the next 3 months of occurrences plus any overdue uncompleted one-time events, sorted chronologically. Each event renders as a full calendar event card (Edit, Complete, Delete buttons). Reached by clicking the events stat chip on the house home page.

### Floors (`house.js`)
The top level of the house hierarchy.

**Firestore**: `floors` — `name`, `floorNumber`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#house` (floor list), `#floor/{id}` (floor detail)

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems (roll-up from rooms/things/sub-things), Quick Task List (roll-up), Activities, Photos, Calendar Events

### Rooms (`house.js`)
Each room belongs to one floor.

**Firestore**: `rooms` — `name`, `floorId`, `sortOrder`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#room/{id}` (room detail)

**Floor plan linkage**: Each room can be drawn as a polygon on the floor plan. The shape links back to the room record — clicking the shape navigates to the room detail page. Dimensions (e.g., "12 × 14 ft · 168 sq ft") are calculated from the polygon.

**Stairs**: A special room type marked as connecting two floors. Appears with a hatch pattern on the floor plan.

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems (roll-up from things/sub-things), Quick Task List (roll-up), Activities, Photos, Calendar Events

### Things (`house.js`)
Items of significance in a room — furniture, appliances, fixtures.

**Firestore**: `things` — `name`, `category`, `roomId`, `description`, `worth`, `notes`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#thing/{id}` (detail)

**Categories**: Furniture, Appliance, Ceiling Fan, Ceiling Light, Electronics, Other. Category badges are color-coded and shown on the list card.

**Thumbnails**: `profilePhotoData` stored on the document; shown as a small image on the list card. Auto-set from the first photo added (LLM or manual). Can be overridden via "Use as Profile" button in the photo gallery.

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems, Quick Task List, Activities, Photos, Calendar Events

### Sub-Things (`house.js`)
Sub-items within a Thing — drawers in a dresser, shelves in a bookcase, compartments in a cabinet.

**Firestore**: `subThings` — `name`, `thingId`, `description`, `worth`, `notes`, `tags[]`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#subthing/{id}` (detail)

**Tags**: Optional free-form tags for grouping/filtering (e.g., "seasonal", "office supplies").

**Thumbnails**: Same pattern as Things — auto-set on first photo, overridable.

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems, Activities, Photos

### Items (`house.js`, `SubThingItems.md`)
The deepest level — individual items inside a Sub-Thing.

**Firestore**: `subThingItems` — `name`, `subThingId`, `description`, `worth`, `notes`, `tags[]`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#item/{id}` (detail)

**Thumbnails**: Same pattern as Things — auto-set on first photo, overridable.

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems, Activities, Photos

### LLM Photo Identification (House)
Things, Sub-Things, and Items can all be added via `+Photo` button:
- Opens photo staging modal
- Photo sent to LLM with a "identify this household item" prompt
- LLM returns name, description, estimated value
- Item saved immediately with photo and thumbnail auto-set
- If LLM cannot identify name: shows alert (item not saved)

### Floor Plan (`floorplan.js`)
An interactive SVG drawing tool for each floor. Accessed via `#floorplan/{floorId}`.

#### View / Edit Mode

The floor plan editor opens in **View mode** by default whenever an existing plan is loaded:
- **View mode**: all items are clickable and selectable; dragging is disabled; the toolbar (Row 2) is hidden; the Dimensions button is hidden; the props bar shows "View Room" / "View Marker" buttons (modal opens with all inputs disabled and Save hidden); Delete button in props bar is hidden; keyboard Delete/Backspace and Ctrl+S are no-ops.
- **Edit mode**: full editing — dragging, adding items, saving, deleting — exactly as before.
- The header shows an **Edit** button in view mode; clicking it switches to edit mode and shows the **Save** button.
- If **no plan exists yet**, the page opens directly in edit mode (nothing to protect) and the floor detail page shows **"Add Floor Plan"** instead of "View Floor Plan".
- On the floor detail page the button reads **"View Floor Plan"** when a plan exists, **"Add Floor Plan"** when it does not.

**Firestore**: `userCol('floorPlans').doc(floorId)` — same document ID as the parent floor. Fields: `widthFt`, `heightFt`, `rooms[]`, `doors[]`, `windows[]`, `plumbing[]`, `ceilingFixtures[]`, `recessedLights[]`, `wallPlates[]`, `fixtures[]`, `plumbingEndpoints[]`, `updatedAt`

---

#### Data Model — ID Relationships (critical)

Every fp room shape has **two** ID fields:
- `shape.id` — internal shape ID generated by `fpGenId()` (e.g. `"fp_r_abc123"`)
- `shape.roomId` — Firestore `rooms` document ID (the linked room record)

All other items (doors, windows, fixtures, etc.) store:
- `item.roomId = fpRoomShape.id` (the **shape** ID, NOT the Firestore room ID)
- `item.id` — unique ID for the item itself (used as `targetId` in cross-entity queries)

**Translation pattern** (used throughout `house.js` and `floorplanitem.js`):
- Room page → item: find shape where `shape.roomId === firestoreRoomId` → use `shape.id` → filter items by `item.roomId === shape.id`
- Item page → room: find shape where `shape.id === item.roomId` → use `shape.roomId` as Firestore room ID

**Item types and their `fpPlan` arrays**:

| `itemType` (URL/targetType) | `fpPlan` array | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `door` | `doors[]` | has `subtype`, `width`, `inseamWidth`, `segmentIndex`, `position`, `swingInward`, `swingLeft`, `name` |
| `window` | `windows[]` | has `width`, `inseamWidth`, `segmentIndex`, `position`, `name` |
| `ceiling` | `ceilingFixtures[]` | has `subtype`, `x`, `y`, `name` |
| `recessedLight` | `recessedLights[]` | has `x`, `y`, `label`, `notes`, `name` |
| `wallplate` | `wallPlates[]` | has `slots[]`, `segmentIndex`, `position`, `targetIds[]`, `notes`, `name` |
| `fixture` | `fixtures[]` | has `fixtureType` (`toilet`/`sink`/`tub`), `orientation` (0–3), `x`, `y`, `name` |
| `plumbingEndpoint` | `plumbingEndpoints[]` | has `endpointType` (`spigot`/`stubout`), `subtype` (cold/hot/both), `x`, `y`, `name` |
| `plumbing` | `plumbing[]` | legacy generic plumbing markers |

`planId` in routes = `floorId` (the floors Firestore doc ID = floorPlans doc ID).

---

#### Canvas Features

- SVG-based canvas with optional grid overlay
- Snap-to-grid in 0.25 ft (3-inch) increments; grid displays 4 tiers: 5ft dark, 1ft medium, 0.5ft light, 0.25ft very faint
- **Coords bar**: always visible above canvas — shows live position + segment info during draw/drag/edit; blank when idle
- SVG cursor label also shows position + segment length near the cursor
- Rectilinear room polygons (all 90° angles; L/T/U shapes supported)
- **Room link modal**: fresh Firestore query on open; unplaced rooms listed first; "Create new room" option; new-name field only shown when "Create new" is selected
- **Dimensions auto-save**: confirming the Dimensions modal immediately saves to Firestore
- Stairs shown with hatch pattern and label; connects-to floor shown in label

---

#### Item Placement and Auto-naming

Every item type has a default name assigned on placement. If the same default name already exists in the room, a suffix is appended ("Door", "Door 2", etc.):

| Type | Default name |
|---|---|
| Door (single) | "Door" |
| Door (french) | "French Door" |
| Door (sliding) | "Sliding Door" |
| Door (pocket) | "Pocket Door" |
| Window | "Window" |
| Toilet | "Toilet" |
| Sink | "Sink" |
| Tub/Shower | "Tub", "Shower", or "Tub/Shower" |
| Ceiling fixture | "Ceiling Fixture" |
| Recessed light | "Recessed Light" |
| Wall plate | "Plate" |
| Spigot | "Spigot" |
| Stub-out | "Stub-out" |

Items without a `name` field (placed before naming was added) fall back to the type label in all display contexts — never shown as blank.

---

#### Door Subtypes

Door `subtype` controls rendering:
- **`single`** (default): swing arc + hinge dot + jamb ticks; swing direction (inward/outward left/right) controls arc side
- **`french`**: center divider post; two short perpendicular panel indicators (≈10 inch) projecting inward or outward; dashed connecting line between tips; hinge dots at each end; "FR" label. **No arc** (arc was removed because arc radius < chord caused SVG to render a large incorrect arc)
- **`sliding`**: two overlapping offset panel rects side-by-side; no arc; "SL" label
- **`pocket`**: dashed rect inset into wall (pocket cavity); solid panel line; "PK" label

Door edit modal shows swing controls that vary by subtype:
- `single` / `pocket`: single swing-direction select (inward-left / inward-right / outward-left / outward-right)
- `french`: separate inward/outward select only (no left/right)
- `sliding`: swing group hidden (no swing for sliding doors)

---

#### Ceiling Fixture Subtypes

`subtype` controls symbol:
- `fan`: 4-blade fan wheel
- `fan-light`: fan wheel + small filled circle at center
- `drop-light`: circle with center dot (pendant)
- `chandelier`: circle + 4 arms with dots at tips
- `flush-mount`: concentric filled rings
- `solar`: 6-ray sun symbol + filled center circle — for solar lights on outdoor/yard floor plans
- `generic`: 8-ray starburst + bulb (default fallback)

Backward compat: `category === 'ceiling-fan'` maps to subtype `fan`.

---

#### Layout Fixtures (Toilet / Sink / Tub/Shower)

Placed via 🛁 **Fixtures flyout** in Layout mode Row 2. Click inside a room to drop immediately (no modal).

- `fixtureType`: `toilet` | `sink` | `tub`
- `orientation`: 0 = north, 1 = east, 2 = south, 3 = west (rotated 90° clockwise per step)
- Rotate button (⟳) in Row 3 cycles orientation 0→1→2→3→0 with silent-save
- Draggable in Layout/Select mode; Edit Marker opens modal with name/orientation/notes/delete
- Toilet: rounded rect (tank, against wall) + oval (bowl, into room)
- Sink: rectangle with circle (drain) inside
- Tub/Shower: tub = rect + inner oval; shower = rect with diagonal cross-hatch; combo = tub render + shower-head dot

---

#### Plumbing Endpoints

Placed in Plumbing mode. Click inside a room to drop (no modal for spigot; modal for stub-out).

- **Spigot** (`endpointType: 'spigot'`): blue circle with nozzle stub and "SP" label
- **Stub-out** (`endpointType: 'stubout'`): circle with letter — "C" (cold, blue), "H" (hot, red), "C/H" (both, purple)
- **Sprinkler head** (`endpointType: 'sprinkler'`): blue circle with spray arc above and "SPR" label — for outdoor/yard floor plans
- Draggable in Plumbing/Select mode; Edit Marker opens modal with name/subtype/notes/delete

---

#### Wall Plates

🔌 Plate tool in Electrical mode. Placed on room walls.

- 1–4 slots per plate; each slot: `type` (switch/outlet) + `subtype` (single-pole/3-way/dimmer/smart for switches; standard/GFCI/220V/USB for outlets)
- Plate width scales with slot count (14px per slot + padding); per-slot symbols and vertical dividers rendered
- Selected: orange stroke + light yellow fill
- Edit Marker modal: slot rows with add/remove (max 4), type/subtype pickers, controls field, breaker link, position-from-wall, notes, save/cancel/delete
- `targetIds[]`: list of ceiling fixture and recessed light IDs this plate controls (same-room wiring)

**External switch slots** — per slot, a switch can be marked "External" to document it controls items outside the current room:
- Checkbox "External (controls items outside this room)" on each switch slot
- When checked, an **External Targets** sub-section appears with target chips and an **Add External Target** button
- **Add External Target** opens a picker: Floor → Room → Item (any floor plan item in any room on any floor, including the Outside floor)
- Target name defaults to the item's display name; editable before saving
- Saved targets shown as removable chips (name + room/floor location)
- Slot symbol renders with `*` appended when external (e.g. S→S\*, 3S→3S\*, D→D\*)
- `slot.external: true` + `slot.externalTargets: [{id, name, floorId, floorName, roomId, roomName, planId, fpItemId}]` stored in Firestore inside the wall plate array

---

#### Recessed Lights

◎ Recessed tool in Electrical mode. Click inside room to drop immediately (no modal).

- Outer circle r=9px white fill, inner circle r=5px light grey
- Drag to reposition; Edit Marker for label/notes; supports Facts/Problems/Activities via `targetType: 'recessedLight'`

---

#### 3-Row Toolbar

**Row 1 — Mode bar** (dark navy): `Layout` | `Electrical` | `Plumbing` — exactly one active; Layout is default. Switching modes: clears selection, resets to Select tool, exits drawing/target-edit.

**Row 2 — Tool bar** (shows by active mode):
- Layout: Select, Room, Type (📐), Door, Window, Fixtures flyout (Toilet/Sink/Tub)
- Electrical: Select, Plate, Ceiling, Recessed, Dim toggle (checkbox)
- Plumbing: Select, Spigot, Stub-out, Dim toggle (checkbox)

**Row 3 — Properties bar** (amber tint): appears when any item is selected in Select mode.
- Shows item type label
- In **edit mode** for non-room items: **Edit Marker**, **Remove**, **Details →** (navigates to `#floorplanitem/{planId}/{itemType}/{itemId}`)
- In **view mode** for non-room items: **View Marker** (opens modal read-only), **Details →** only — Remove is hidden
- **Rotate** (⟳) button: fixtures only; edit mode only; cycles orientation
- **Edit Targets** button: wall plates in Electrical mode only; edit mode only; enters target-selection mode
- For rooms in edit mode: **Edit Room** button (no Remove, no Details); in view mode: **View Room**

Layout items (rooms, doors, windows, fixtures) can only be interacted with in Layout mode. Electrical items only in Electrical mode. Plumbing items only in Plumbing mode.

---

#### Electrical Overlay

- **Dim toggle**: when checked (default), structural SVG group renders at 25% opacity
- **Wiring lines**: when a wall plate is selected, dashed colored lines draw from plate to each target fixture (blue/red/purple/cyan per slot)
- **Edit Targets**: Row 3 "Edit Targets" → target-selection mode; linked fixtures shown with amber ring + warm fill + center dot; available fixtures shown with dashed teal ring; click to toggle; Done/Escape exits and saves silently
- **3-way auto-detection**: two or more plates sharing the same target → both plates show a purple "3-way" badge (Electrical mode only)

---

#### Drag and Drop Behavior

- **Room drag**: moves entire polygon + all floating items in the room (ceiling fixtures, recessed lights, fixtures, plumbing, plumbingEndpoints). Wall-attached items (doors, windows, wall plates) move automatically since they use `segmentIndex + position` relative to the wall
- **Door / window drag**: slides along the item's current wall segment. **0.3 ft minimum movement threshold** before drag starts — prevents a tap-to-select from nudging the item (same guard as room drag's 0.15 ft threshold)
- **Ceiling fixture, recessed light, fixture, plumbing endpoint drag**: free-form reposition anywhere inside the room
- **Tap (no drag)**: selects the item without moving it; `fpSelectMarker` is called only if no drag occurred
- **Auto-select on add**: after placing any new item, tool auto-switches to Select and the new item is pre-selected
- **Silent-save on drag**: all drags call `fpSilentSave()` on mouseup — position persists without pressing Save

---

#### Drawing Modes

**Free Draw**: click corners; Enter key places a corner without an exact click; close-shape hit radius 20px.

**Type Numbers** (📐 Type): click canvas to set anchor → type command string (e.g. `14, R, 21, R, 14`) → live SVG preview → Save Room. Direction tokens: R/L/U/D. Status badge shows if shape closes cleanly.

---

#### Zoom

- Slider (25%–800%); mouse wheel; two-finger pinch (all centered on focal point)
- Double-click zoom label → reset to 100%
- Resets to fit-to-window on every plan load

---

#### Corner Editing

**Drag**: drag a corner handle dot; coords bar shows live cyan/orange wall lengths for the two adjacent segments.

**Double-click**: inline edit mode — two number inputs (cyan/orange) for the adjacent wall lengths; Enter/Escape exits.

### Floor Plan Item Detail (`floorplanitem.js`)
A detail page for any individual floor plan object (door, window, fixture, recessed light, etc.).

**Route**: `#floorplanitem/{planId}/{itemType}/{itemId}`
- `planId` = Firestore `floorPlans` doc ID (same as the floor's Firestore ID)
- `itemType` = one of: `door`, `window`, `ceiling`, `recessedLight`, `wallplate`, `fixture`, `plumbingEndpoint`, `plumbing`
- `itemId` = the item's `id` field within the plan array

**Features**:
- Page header shows item display name (falls back to type label if no name set) with a **Rename** button
- Inline name-edit row (hidden until Rename clicked): text input + Save/Cancel; saves by updating the relevant array in the `floorPlans` doc
- Meta line: type badge (human-readable, e.g. "Ceiling Fan", "Pocket Door", "Tub/Shower") + room link + "Floor Plan" link
- Breadcrumb: House › Floor Name › Room Name › Item Name
- **Cross-entity sections**: Problems/Concerns, Facts, Quick Task List, Activity History, Photos — all wired via `targetType = itemType`, `targetId = itemId` using the existing cross-entity helpers
- Entry point from floor plan canvas: **"Details →"** button in the Row 3 Properties bar appears for all non-room selected items

**"Items in this Room" section on Room detail page**:
- Appears at the bottom of the room detail page (`page-room`)
- Loads `floorPlans` doc for the room's floor; collects all items across all arrays where `item.roomId === room.id`
- Grouped by: **Layout** (doors, windows, fixtures), **Electrical** (ceilingFixtures, recessedLights, wallPlates), **Plumbing** (plumbingEndpoints, plumbing)
- Each row shows: type icon + type label + item display name + "Details →" link to `#floorplanitem/{planId}/{itemType}/{itemId}`
- Empty state shown if no floor plan exists or room has no items

**Floor Plan Item Rollup — Open Concerns and Active Projects (Phase 4)**:
- Rendered by `loadFpItemRollup()` (room/floor scope) and `loadFpItemRollupForHouse()` (house scope) in `house.js`
- **Room detail page** (`page-room`): "Open Concerns — Items in this Room" + "Active Quick Tasks — Items in this Room"
- **Floor detail page** (`page-floor`): "Open Concerns — Items on this Floor" + "Active Quick Tasks — Items on this Floor" — appears below the floor plan thumbnail
- **House detail page** (`page-house`): "Open Concerns — Whole House" + "Active Quick Tasks — Whole House" — appears after the Projects panel
- Each section is **collapsed by default**; click header to expand. Section only renders if count > 0.
- Header shows a blue count badge; arrow rotates 90° when expanded.
- Expanded view: rows with type icon + item display name + concern/project title + "Details →" link to `#floorplanitem/{planId}/{itemType}/{itemId}`
- Data: queries `problems` where `targetType in FP_ITEM_TYPES` and `status == 'open'`; queries `projects` where `targetType in FP_ITEM_TYPES` then filters `status !== 'complete'` in-memory
- Room scope uses `shape.roomId === room.id` to find the fp shape, then filters items by `item.roomId === shape.id`
- House scope loads all floor plan docs in parallel via `Promise.all`

**Electrical Controls — Reverse Lookup (room detail page only)**:
- Section appears on `page-room` below the rollup, rendered by `loadRoomElectricalControls(roomId)` in `house.js`
- Scans all `floorPlans` docs; for each wall plate slot where `slot.external === true`, checks if any `slot.externalTargets[].roomId` matches the current room
- If matches found, renders an "⚡ Electrical Controls" section listing each target (name, location) and the controlling wall plate (floor plan link)
- Useful on "Outside" floor rooms (e.g. "Firepit Area") — shows which indoor switch controls the flood light or solar light placed there
- No dedicated Firestore collection; scan is O(floors × plates) which is acceptably small for a home

### Breaker Panel (`house.js`)
Tracks the electrical breaker panel as a grid of slots.

**Firestore**: `breakers` — per-slot records with `slotNumber`, `label`, `amperage`, `type`, `status`, `notes`

**UI**: Visual grid matching the physical panel layout; color-coded by status; add/edit each slot's label and details.

## Part 4: Garage

**Plan document**: `Garage.md`

The Garage section mirrors the House section structure but is separate. It pre-seeds two default garage rooms ("Garage" and "Attic") on first visit.

**Firestore collections**: `garageRooms`, `garageThings`, `garageSubThings`

**Routes**: `#garage` (room list), `#garageroom/{id}`, `#garagething/{id}`, `#garagesubthing/{id}`

**Features**: Same as House — Things, Sub-Things, and their cross-entity sections (Facts, Problems, Quick Task List, Activities, Photos, Calendar Events). LLM photo identification also available.

---

## Part 5: Structures

**Plan document**: `YardStructures.md`

Outdoor structures separate from the main house — sheds, decks, pergolas, gazebos, pools, etc.

**Firestore collections**: `structures`, `structureThings`, `structureSubThings`

**Routes**: `#structures` (list), `#structure/{id}`, `#structurething/{id}`, `#structuresubthing/{id}`

**Features**: Full feature set — Facts, Problems (roll-up), Quick Task List (roll-up), Activities, Photos, Calendar Events. Same hierarchy as House but without floor plans or breaker panels.

---

## Part 6: Vehicles

**Plan document**: `Vehicles.md`

Tracks vehicles with maintenance history, mileage, and documentation.

**Firestore**: `vehicles` — `year`, `make`, `model`, `trim`, `color`, `vin`, `licensePlate`, `purchaseDate`, `purchasePrice`, `notes`, `archived`, `archivedAt`, `archivedReason`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#vehicles` (list), `#vehicle/{id}` (detail)

**Archival**: Vehicles can be marked as sold/gone with an optional reason. Archived vehicles move to a collapsed "Archived" section on the list — they are not deleted, so their full history is preserved.

**Mileage Log**:
- **Firestore**: `mileageLogs` — `vehicleId`, `date`, `mileage`, `notes`, `createdAt`
- Add odometer reading entries; displayed newest-first with delete buttons
- Can be logged via SecondBrain ("Add 35K miles to the truck")

**[Shared]**: Facts, Problems, Quick Task List, Activities, Photos, Calendar Events

---

## Part 7: Collections

**Plan document**: `Collections.md`

Tracks physical collectible inventories. Each collection is a named list with a type; each item within it has type-specific fields.

**Firestore**:
- `collections` — `name`, `type`, `label1/2/3` (generic custom labels), `createdAt`
- `collectionItems` — `collectionId`, `name`, `typeData{}`, `acquiredDate`, `pricePaid`, `estimatedValue`, `notes`, `locationRef{}`, `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`

**Routes**: `#collections` (list), `#collection/{id}` (collection detail), `#collectionitem/{id}` (item detail)

### Collection Types

| Type | Type-Specific Fields | Sort Order | Filter Field |
|------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| Comics | series, issueNumber, variant, publisher, year | Series A-Z → issue # | series |
| Records/Albums | format, artist, album, label, year | Format → artist → album | artist |
| Hats | style, color, brand, year | Name A-Z | name |
| Hat Pins | description | Name A-Z | name |
| Beanie Babies | style, year, hasTags | Name A-Z | name |
| Ceramic Stadiums | team, year | Name A-Z | name |
| Books & Magazines | type (Book/Magazine), author, publisher, year, isbn, issueDate | Name A-Z | title + author |
| Generic | label1/2/3 values (custom labels per collection) | Name A-Z | name |

### Collection List Page
- Shows all collections as cards with item count + total estimated worth
- Add Collection button

### Collection Detail Page
- Item count + total estimated worth in header
- Client-side filter bar (search field pre-labeled by type, e.g., "Filter by series…")
- Item rows with: 48×48 thumbnail (if set), name, key field (author/artist/etc.), estimated value
- Add item (manual) and `+Photo` (LLM identification) buttons

### Collection Item Detail Page
- Full type-specific fields in an info card
- Acquired date, price paid, estimated value
- Location reference (free-text, e.g., "Shelf 3, Box B")
- Photos (gallery, with thumbnail support)

### Thumbnails
- `profilePhotoData` stored on each `collectionItems` document
- Auto-set from the first photo added (LLM or manual `+Photo`)
- Multiple photos: "⭐ Use as Thumbnail" button in the photo gallery
- Shown as 48×48 image in the item list row

### LLM Identification for Collections
- User taps `+Photo` → opens photo staging modal
- Photo sent to LLM with type-specific prompt (returns JSON matching the type's schema)
- Result shown in a review modal (`collectionShowResultModal`)
- On confirm: item saved to Firestore, thumbnail auto-set, photo stored
- "Add Another" button: resets modal for next item without leaving the page
- **Race condition handling**: `loadCollectionPage()` is deferred 100ms after `collectionShowResultModal()` updates the DOM, so the re-render doesn't race with the modal update

---

## Part 8: Life

**Plan document**: `PersonalPlan.md`

The Life section covers personal tracking — journal, people, health, notes, and major life events.

### Journal (`journal.js`)
Daily entry logging with optional tracking metrics.

**Firestore**:
- `journalEntries` — `date`, `entryTime` (HH:MM), `entryText`, `mentionedPersonIds[]`, `placeIds[]`, `isCheckin` (bool), `sourceEventId?`, `sourceVisitId?`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- `journalTrackingItems` — `date`, `category`, `value`, `createdAt`
- `journalCategories` — `name`, `createdAt`
- `lifeEventLogs` — `logDate`, `logTime`, `body`, `eventId`, `mentionedPersonIds[]`, `createdAt` (mini logs from Life Calendar)

**Routes**: `#journal` (list), `#journal-entry` (add/edit), `#journal-tracking` (tracking entries), `#journal-categories` (manage categories)

**@Mentions**: Typing `@` in the entry text triggers an autocomplete dropdown of tracked people by name.

**Date range filter**: Sticky per-user preference (7/30/60/90 days or custom) saved to `userCol('settings').doc('journal')`.

**Tracking items**: Numeric values logged per category per day (e.g., weight, mood, blood pressure). A trend view shows all values for a selected category over time.

**Life Event Logs integration**: Mini log entries from Life Calendar events appear inline in the journal feed. Toggle "Show Event Notes" to show/hide them.

**Place linking**: Journal entries can be linked to one or more places (`placeIds[]`). When an entry was created via the Check-In flow (`isCheckin: true`), a check-in badge (📍 checked-in) is shown in the journal feed. The entry form shows a "Place" search field to attach a place; if none exists it auto-creates one via `placesSaveNew()`.

**Check-in flow**: The "📍 Check In" button (on the QuickLog screen and SecondBrain) opens the check-in form pre-filled with a venue. On save, it creates a journal entry with `isCheckin: true` and `placeIds: [placeId]`.

**Tab key**: In the journal entry textarea, if the @mention dropdown is open, Tab selects the first name in the list (same as clicking it) and keeps focus in the textarea. If the dropdown is not open, Tab inserts 4 spaces (handled by `_initTabIndentTextareas` in `app.js`).

**Voice-to-text** (`initVoiceToText` in `journal.js`): 🎤 Speak button uses the Web Speech API (`continuous: true`). Spoken punctuation words are converted by `applySpokenPunctuation()`. Editing commands are handled by `_applyVoiceEditCommand()` and execute on the textarea directly — they are never appended as text. Commands must be spoken as their own phrase (pause before and after): — **"new line"** → inserts `\n` — **"new paragraph"** → inserts `\n\n` — **"delete last word"** → removes the last word — **"delete last sentence"** → removes everything after the last `.` `!` or `?` (clears all if no sentence boundary found) — **"clear all"** → empties the textarea. Full punctuation command list: period, comma, question mark, exclamation point, colon, semicolon, dash, hyphen, ellipsis, dot dot dot, open/close paren.

### Contacts (`contacts.js`)

Renamed from "People". Tracks personal contacts and medical/service professionals and facilities.

**Firestore** (collection name unchanged: `people`):
- `people` — `name`, `nickname`, `category` (see below), `specialty?`, `personalType?`, `businessType?`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `website?`, `facebookUrl`, `howKnown`, `notes`, `profilePhotoData?`, `parentPersonId?`, `createdAt`
- `peopleImportantDates` — `personId`, `label`, `month`, `day`, `year?`, `recurrence`, `createdAt`
- `peopleInteractions` — `personId`, `date`, `text`, `sourceType`, `createdAt`
- `lookups/serviceTrades` — `{ values: [...] }` full list of trades (defaults: Plumber, Electrician, HVAC, Pest Control, Handyman)
- `lookups/personalContactTypes` — `{ values: [...] }` full list of relationship types (defaults: Friend, Family, Neighbor, Coworker, Acquaintance)
- `lookups/businessTypes` — `{ values: [...] }` full list of business categories (defaults: Electronics Store, Garden Store, Restaurant, Hardware Store, Grocery Store)

**Contact type categories** (stored in `category` field):
- **Personal** — shows `personalType` dropdown (Friend, Family, Neighbor, Coworker, Acquaintance + user-defined); types stored in `lookups/personalContactTypes`; on-the-fly add in modal
- **Medical Professional** — shows `specialty` text input with datalist (~35 built-in options); custom specialties saved to `lookups/specialties`
- **Medical Facility** — clinic, hospital, lab, pharmacy
- **Service Professional** — shows `trade` dropdown (Plumber, Electrician, HVAC, Pest Control, Handyman + user-defined); trades stored in `lookups/serviceTrades`; on-the-fly add in modal
- **Business** — shows `businessType` dropdown (Electronics Store, Garden Store, Restaurant, Hardware Store, Grocery Store + user-defined); types stored in `lookups/businessTypes`; on-the-fly add in modal
- **Pet**
- **Other**

**Contact Types settings page** (`#settings-contact-lists`): Accessible from Settings hub (tile renamed from "Contact Lists" to "Contact Types"). Three cards — "Service Trades", "Personal Contact Types", and "Business Types". Each shows a list of all items with Rename and Delete buttons per item. An "Add" input at the bottom adds new items. Changes are saved immediately to Firestore.

**Routes**: `#contacts` (list), `#contact/{id}` (detail). Legacy `#people` / `#person/{id}` redirect to the new routes.

**Hierarchy**: Sub-contacts (`parentPersonId`) allow grouping (e.g., family members under a parent record). The sub-contacts section heading dynamically adapts: **"Family Members"** for Personal/other categories, **"Staff"** for Medical Facility contacts. The empty-state text also adapts accordingly.

**Contact detail sections**:
- Contact info: specialty (Medical Professional only), phone (tel: link), email (mailto: link), address (Google Maps link), website (external link), Facebook, how known, notes
- Important dates: birthdays, anniversaries — shown on contact detail and referenced in calendar
- Photos: full gallery, profile photo support
- Interactions: log of meetings/conversations
- Shared life events: Life Calendar events tagged with this contact
- Facts

**ContactPicker component** (`buildContactPicker(containerId, options)`): Reusable searchable dropdown that filters contacts by category. Used by Care Team (Phase 2), Appointments (Phase 3), and other health features. Supports inline contact creation via `allowCreate: true`. When `filterCategory` is set, queries all contacts with that category (including sub-contacts like staff under a Medical Facility) — a staff member with `category: 'Medical Professional'` will appear in the provider picker even if they have a `parentPersonId`. Supports `facilityPickerId` option: when the provider field is focused with an empty query and a facility is already selected, the dropdown immediately shows all staff sub-contacts of that facility (filtered by category) under a "Staff at [Facility]" header — single tap to select.

**List view**: Category badge with color coding (green = Personal, blue = Medical Professional, purple = Medical Facility, orange = Service Professional, grey = Other). Specialty shown as subline for Medical Professionals; address shown for Medical Facilities.

### Health (`health.js`)

**Plan document**: `HealthEnhancements.md`

A comprehensive medical tracking hub.

**My Health main page tile order** (2-column grid):
Row 1: Conditions, Concerns | Row 2: Appointments, Health Visits | Row 3: Medications, Supplements | Row 4: Blood Work, Vitals | Row 5: Insurance, Emergency Info | Row 6: Vaccinations, Allergies | Row 7: Eye / Glasses | Row 8: My Care Team (full-width)

**My Care Team** (`#health-care-team`):
- Dedicated page listing the user's medical care team
- Data: `userCol('healthCareTeam').doc('default')` — single document with `members[]` array
- Each member: `{ role (free text), providerContactId?, facilityContactId? }`
- Member cards show role, provider (tappable link → `#contact/{id}`), facility (tappable link)
- "+ Add Member" button → modal with Role input + ContactPicker for provider (Medical Professional) + ContactPicker for facility (Medical Facility)
- Both provider and facility are optional per member
- Edit / Remove per member (Remove confirms before deleting)

**Firestore collections** (all under `userCol`):

| Collection | Key Fields |
|------------|------------|
| `healthVisits` | date, type, provider (legacy), providerType (legacy), facilityContactId, providerContactId, concernIds[], conditionIds[], reason, whatWasDone, outcome, cost, notes, linkedJournalEntryId? |
| `medications` | name, dosage, purpose, prescribedBy, startDate, endDate, status (active/completed), type (Ongoing/Short-term/As-needed), concernIds[], conditionIds[] |
| `concerns` | title, bodyArea, startDate, status (open/resolved/promoted), resolvedDate, summary, promotedToConditionId, promotedDate |
| `healthConcernLogs` | concernId, date, note, painScale?, type (manual/system/visit-note), visitId? |
| `conditions` | name, category, diagnosedDate, diagnosedBy, status (active/managed/resolved), managementNotes |
| `healthConditionLogs` | conditionId, date, note, painScale, type (manual/system/visit-note), visitId (optional), createdAt |
| `bloodWork` | date, lab, orderedBy, notes, markers[] (name/value/unit/referenceRange/flagged) |
| `vitals` | date, time, type (BP/HR/O2/Glucose/Temp/Other), value1, value2, unit, notes |
| `supplements` | name, dosage, brand, reason, frequency, startDate, endDate, status (active/stopped) |
| `vaccinations` | name, date, dateApproximate, provider, lotNumber, nextDueDate |
| `eyePrescriptions` | date, type (Distance/Reading), rightEye{}, leftEye{}, pd, provider |
| `insurance` | provider, policyNumber, groupNumber, memberId, copay, deductible, photoDocuments[] |
| `emergencyInfo` | emergencyContacts[], allergies[], medicalAdvances, dnr, notes |
| `healthAppointments` | date, time, type, facilityContactId, providerContactId, concernIds[], conditionIds[], notes, status (scheduled/completed/cancelled/converted), linkedVisitId |

**Appointments** (`#health-appointments`): List page shows Overdue / Upcoming / Past sections. Each card shows: type badge, date/time (tappable — opens edit modal, same as Edit button), Facility (tappable link to `#contact/{id}` if contactId set), Provider (tappable link or plain text), concern/condition chips, notes. Actions: Edit (hidden on converted), ✓ Mark Done (scheduled/overdue only), View Visit link (if linkedVisitId set). **Delete and Cancel Appointment are in the edit modal** (not the card). Edit modal bottom row: left side has Delete (always shown when editing) + Cancel Appt (shown only for active appointments — not cancelled/completed/converted); right side has Close + Save. "Cancel Appt" saves current notes field + sets `status: 'cancelled'` in one step, then closes modal. Add/Edit modal: date, time, type dropdown (Dr. Visit / Specialist / Follow-up / Physical or Annual / Urgent Care / Emergency / Dental / Eye Exam / Lab or Test / Procedure), status, Facility ContactPicker (Medical Facility, allowCreate), Provider ContactPicker (Medical Professional, allowCreate, optional), scrollable concern/condition checkbox list (open concerns + active/managed conditions), notes. Mark Done → opens `apptConvertModal` to create a Health Visit; on save sets `status: 'converted'` and `linkedVisitId`. Converted appointments show no Edit button and a "View Visit" link.

**Health Visits** (`#health-visits`, `#health-visit/{id}`): List page shows visits in reverse-chronological order grouped by year. Each card shows: date, provider (resolved via contactMap: `providerContactId` → contact name, then `providerText`, then legacy `provider`), type badge. Visit detail page header shows "[Type] — [formatted date]" (falls back to "Visit — [date]" if no type). Detail rows: Facility (tappable link to `#contact/{id}` if `facilityContactId` set, or plain text from `facilityText`, hidden if neither set), Provider (tappable link or plain text, falls back to `providerText` then legacy `provider` field), Provider Type, Reason for Visit, What Was Done, Outcome/Next Steps, Cost, Notes. **"Visit Notes"** section (hidden when none): loads `concernUpdates` + `healthConditionLogs` where `visitId == visit.id`, renders each as "⚠️/📋 Name — note text" — view-only. "This visit covered" section: tappable concern chips (→ `#health-concern/{id}`) and condition chips (→ `#health-condition/{id}`) from `concernIds[]` / `conditionIds[]`; section hidden if both arrays empty. **"Notes & Meds ›"** button in the "This visit covered" header navigates to `#health-visit-step2/{id}` — accessible any time (not only immediately after Mark Done). **Edit visit modal**: provider pre-fills from `providerText` (falling back to legacy `provider`); concern/condition field is a multi-select checkbox list (open concerns + active/managed conditions) replacing the old single-select dropdown; saves to `providerText`, `concernIds[]`, `conditionIds[]`. Provider Type dropdown removed from the modal — when `providerContactId` is set, the detail page auto-pulls `specialty` from the contact record instead.

**Create Journal / View Journal button** (visit detail page header): Links a journal entry to the visit via one-to-one relationship. `linkedJournalEntryId` on the visit doc; `sourceVisitId` on the journal entry. Button shows "Create Journal" when no entry is linked, "View Journal" when one is. **Create Journal flow**: Gathers visit data asynchronously (facility, provider, reason, what was done, outcome, cost, notes, covered concern/condition names, visit-level notes from `concernUpdates`/`healthConditionLogs`, medications from `prescribedAtVisitId`, blood work from `orderedAtVisitId`). If an LLM is configured (`userCol('settings').doc('llm')`), shows a `confirm("Have AI create entry?")` prompt. **AI path**: fetches full history for all addressed concerns (all `concernUpdates`) and conditions (all `healthConditionLogs`), blood work markers, builds a system+user prompt asking for a personal journal entry (not a clinical note), calls the LLM (supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, OpenRouter), and populates the journal textarea with the response. **Manual path**: assembles labeled lines (Facility, Provider, Reason, etc.) plus a blood work summary line, pre-fills the textarea. In both paths, the journal entry date/time are set to the visit's date/time and a back-link `sourceVisitId` is saved on the journal entry; `linkedJournalEntryId` is saved on the visit doc after creation. Cancelling from a visit-sourced journal entry returns to the visit page. Journal entry shows a "View Visit ›" button when `sourceVisitId` is set.

**Concern Detail** (`#health-concern/{id}`): Collapsible-section layout. Summary card at top shows: title, status badge (Open/Resolved/Promoted), body area, since date, summary text, resolved date (if resolved), Edit + Mark Resolved/Reopen buttons. Collapsed section headers show a muted count badge, e.g. "Medications (2)", so the user knows records exist without expanding. Six collapsible sections — **Journal Updates** (starts expanded; all others start collapsed): — chronological log entries (date, pain scale, note); entries from a visit show a clickable **"Visit ›"** chip next to the date — clicking navigates to `#health-visit-step2/{visitId}` where notes can be reviewed/updated; Add Entry button opens `concernUpdateModal`; **Linked Medications** — medications whose `concernIds[]` includes this concern's id; shows name + dosage, Unlink button; "Link Medications" button opens `medPickerModal`; **Appointments & Visits** — appointments from `appointments` where `concernIds array-contains` + visits from `healthVisits` where `concernIds array-contains` (plus legacy `concernId == id`); each row shows date (tappable link) + type/provider meta; **Photos** — photo gallery; **Facts** — key-value facts. Med Picker overlay (`medPickerModal`): lists all non-discontinued medications as checkboxes, pre-checked if already linked; "Add New Medication" opens med modal and returns to picker on save (via `window._medPickerCallback`); Save applies `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` diffs in a Firestore batch. **"↑ Promote to Condition" button** at bottom opens `promoteModal`; hidden once promoted. **Archived state** (when `status === 'promoted'`): purple "Promoted to Condition" banner with date + "View Condition →" link appears; all edit controls hidden via CSS class `concern-archived`; page is read-only.

**Promote to Condition** (`promoteModal`): Pre-filled with concern title → Condition Name, body area → Category. On "Promote": queries all conditions for a case-insensitive name match. No match → creates new condition (`active`, diagnosed date from concern start date) then runs migration. Match found → shows conflict section: "Create New" (creates second condition) or "Merge into existing" (appends to existing condition). Migration (`_doPromotionWork`): copies `concernUpdates` journal → `healthConditionLogs` (prefixed "Imported from concern: [title] — "); adds `conditionIds arrayUnion` to all linked meds/appointments/visits; re-points photos from `targetType: 'concern'` to `targetType: 'condition'`; sets concern `status: 'promoted'`, `promotedToConditionId`, `promotedDate`; adds first condition log: "Promoted/Merged from concern: [title] on [date]." All in a single Firestore batch. After: navigates to the condition detail page.

**Condition Detail** (`#health-condition/{id}`): Collapsible-section layout (mirrors concern detail). Summary card at top shows: name, status badge (Active/Managed/Resolved), category, diagnosed date, management notes, cycle-status button (Active → Managed → Resolved → Active), Edit + Delete buttons. Collapsed section headers show a muted count badge (e.g. "Medications (1)") loaded alongside the section data. Six collapsible sections — **Journal** (starts expanded): log entries from `healthConditionLogs` (date, pain scale, note, type); entries from a visit show a clickable **"Visit ›"** chip — navigates to `#health-visit-step2/{visitId}`; Add Note button opens `conditionUpdateModal`; **Medications** (collapsed): medications whose `conditionIds[]` includes this id; Unlink button, "+ Add Med" → `openMedPicker('condition', id)`; **Appointments & Visits** (collapsed): queries `appointments` + `healthVisits` where `conditionIds array-contains id`; **Photos** (collapsed): targetType `condition`; **Facts** (collapsed): targetType `condition`; **Projects** (collapsed): targetType `condition`. Condition cards on the list page are tappable (click navigates to detail; button clicks do not bubble).

**Mark Done 2-Step Flow**: When an appointment is marked Done, the convert modal (Step 1) opens pre-filled from the appointment: date (today), time, visit type (from `appointment.type`), facility display (tappable link if `facilityContactId` set, or plain text from `facilityText`), "Who did you see?" text input (pre-filled from `providerText` or contact name). Legacy Provider/ProviderType fields replaced. Single concern dropdown removed — concern/condition linking carried forward from appointment. After saving the visit record (which copies `concernIds[]`, `conditionIds[]`, `type`, `facilityContactId`, `providerContactId` from the appointment), navigates to Step 2 (`#health-visit-step2/{visitId}`). Step 2 page: accordion list of all linked concerns/conditions (tagged ⚠️ Concern / 📋 Condition); each item has a **🎤 Speak** button next to the Notes label (voice-to-text via Web Speech API); if a note was previously saved for this concern/condition from this same visit, it is pre-loaded into the textarea for editing; saving updates the existing note rather than creating a duplicate. Medications sub-section: existing linked meds with ✕ unlink; **"+ New Med"** opens the Add Medication modal (visit pre-selected) — after save the med is auto-linked and the list refreshes; **"+ Link Existing"** opens the med picker overlay. Each type has two buttons: **"+ New Concern/Condition"** (inline stacked form — inputs are full-width for easy mobile typing; creates a new record + links it) and **"+ Add Existing Concern/Condition"** (inline select — loads open concerns / active conditions not already on the visit; selecting one links it via `arrayUnion` and adds it to the accordion). "Done → Visit" saves any non-empty notes as `concernUpdates` (type: 'visit-note', visitId) or `healthConditionLogs` (same) then navigates to `#health-visit/{id}`. Skipping notes is valid.

**Routes**: `#health`, `#health-visits`, `#health-visit/{id}`, `#health-visit-step2/{id}`, `#health-medications`, `#health-conditions`, `#health-condition/{id}`, `#health-concerns`, `#health-concern/{id}`, `#health-bloodwork`, `#health-bloodwork-detail/{id}`, `#health-vitals`, `#health-supplements`, `#health-vaccinations`, `#health-eye`, `#health-insurance`, `#health-insurance-detail/{id}`, `#health-emergency`, `#health-appointments`, `#health-allergies`

**Blood Work LLM Import**: User pastes lab report text → LLM extracts structured markers (name, value, unit, reference range, flagged status) → editable preview before save.

**Medication Photos**: Each medication card has a "Photos" button that opens a dedicated photo modal with Camera / Gallery / Paste upload options. Photos stored in `photos` collection with `targetType: 'medication'`.

**Scan Rx Label (LLM Vision)**: The Add/Edit Medication modal has a "📷 Scan Rx Label" button. User selects a photo of their prescription receipt; the app compresses it and sends it to the configured LLM (gpt-4o / grok-2-vision) with a structured extraction prompt. LLM returns JSON: name, dosage, prescribedBy, startDate, type (Ongoing/Short-term/As-needed), notes (Rx#, NDC, qty, refills, insurance savings). Fields are auto-populated for review before saving. The scanned image is automatically saved as a photo on the medication after save.

**Vitals trend**: Select a vital type, see all readings over time in a table.

### Notes / Notebooks (`notes.js`)

**Plan document**: `Notes.md`

A notebook-organized note-taking system.

**Firestore**:
- `notebooks` — `name`, `color` (gradient CSS string), `noteCount`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- `notes` — `notebookId`, `body`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

**Routes**: `#notes` (notebook list), `#notebook/{id}` (note list), `#note/{id}` (view/edit)

**Color swatches**: 8 preset gradient colors for notebooks. Rendered as colored cards.

**Default notebook**: Auto-created "Default" gray notebook on first visit; cannot be deleted.

**Search**: Global search across all note body text.

**New note save**: After saving a new note, the app navigates back to the notebook list (not to the note's edit page).

**Tab key**: In the note body textarea, pressing Tab inserts 4 spaces instead of moving focus to the next field.

### Life Main Page (`#life`)

Landing page showing tile shortcuts to Journal, Contacts, Health, Notes, and Calendar. Below the tiles, a **"Coming Up"** section (hidden when empty) shows events within the next 30 days, sorted by date. Two sources are merged:
- **Annual contact dates** (`peopleImportantDates` where `recurrence == annual`) — shows label, person name (tappable link to `#contact/{id}`), and "turns N" age badge if a birth year is set
- **Upcoming life calendar events** (`lifeEvents` where `startDate` in next 30 days, excluding attended/missed/didntgo) — shows event title as a tappable link to `#life-event/{id}`

Each item shows a relative time label: "Today!", "Tomorrow", or "In N days".

### Life Calendar (`lifecalendar.js`)

**Plan document**: `LifeCalendar.md`

Tracks major life events — trips, milestones, goals, relationships.

**Firestore**:
- `lifeEvents` — `title`, `description`, `startDate`, `endDate?`, `startTime?` (HH:MM), `endTime?` (HH:MM), `location?` (manual text), `locationContactId?` (people doc ID — mutually exclusive with `location`), `categoryId?`, `status` (upcoming/in-progress/completed/past), `peopleIds[]`, `notes?`, `miniLogEnabled`, `createdAt`
- `lifeCategories` — `name`, `color`, `createdAt`
- `lifeEventLogs` — `logDate`, `logTime`, `body`, `eventId`, `mentionedPersonIds[]`, `createdAt`

**Health Appointments in Calendar**: `healthAppointments` are loaded alongside `lifeEvents` and displayed in both list and grid views.
- Appointments are normalized to a common shape (`_kind: 'appt'`) with `startDate`, `startTime`, and a title built from `type` + provider name
- Shown in red (`linear-gradient(135deg,#ef4444,#f87171)`) with an **Appt** pill badge
- **List view**: filtered by status (scheduled = Upcoming, completed = Attended; missed filter excludes appointments); hidden when a category filter is active; subject to the "show past" date cutoff (see below)
- **Grid view**: all non-cancelled appointments always appear regardless of status filter (past appointments visible when browsing past months)
- Clicking an appointment card or grid bar navigates to `#health-appointments`

**Show Past 30 Days toggle** (list view only):
- Visible in list view; hidden in grid view
- Off by default; not sticky (resets on every page load and when switching back to list view from grid)
- When OFF: list view shows only events/appointments with `startDate >= today` (for "Upcoming" and "Upcoming + Attended" status filters)
- When ON: date cutoff extends to 30 days in the past; **attended and "didn't go" events within that window are also shown** — the status filter is relaxed for past events so nothing disappears after being marked
- Does not apply to "Attended", "Missed", or "All" status filters — those are already past-looking and keep their own filter
- **Grid view**: all life events are shown regardless of status filter (same as health appointments). Events on any date — past, today, or future — are always visible on the grid when an upcoming-style filter is active. This means an event marked "attended" (even if its scheduled date is today or in the future, e.g. user went early) remains visible on the grid.

**Routes**: `#life-calendar` (list), `#life-event/{id}` (detail/edit), `#life-event/new` (create)

**Event Form**:
- Title, start date, end date (with validation — end date cannot be before start date), optional start time, optional end time
- Category (color-coded), status dropdown, **location** (see below), people tags, description
- **Location field**: two radio buttons — **Contacts** and **Manual**
  - **Contacts** (default for new events): shows a dropdown of top-level contacts with a **"Show Personal"** checkbox (unchecked by default); Personal-category contacts are hidden unless checked; selecting a contact stores `locationContactId`; `location` is cleared
  - **Manual**: shows a free-text input ("City, venue, etc."); stores `location`; `locationContactId` is cleared; "Show Personal" checkbox is hidden
  - On edit: presence of `locationContactId` sets the radio to Contacts and pre-selects the contact; if the saved contact is a Personal contact, "Show Personal" is auto-checked so it appears in the list
  - Event cards show the **contact name** as the location badge when `locationContactId` is set
  - **Today's events**: if a life event has `locationContactId` and its `startDate` equals today, the card shows the contact's address (📍 link to Google Maps) and phone (📞 tel: link) — same as health appointments with `facilityContactId`
- Mini log textarea (journal-style notes attached to the event)
- Top-level Save button (next to title) and bottom Save button
- Saving a **new** event navigates to `#life-calendar` (not the event detail page)
- Saving an **edited** event navigates to `#life-calendar`

**Status**: Events auto-transition between upcoming/in-progress/completed/past based on dates.

**People linking**: Events can tag multiple people from the `people` collection. Linked events appear on each person's detail page.

**Mini logs**: Inline journal-style entries attached to a life event. Appear in the main journal feed (togglable).

## Part 9: Places & Check-In

**JS file**: `js/places.js`

Tracks real-world places the user visits. Places tie together journal check-ins, activities, and a searchable location history. Uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for discovery and geocoding — no paid API key required.

### Places List (`#places`)
- Shows all saved places as cards (name, address/city, category)
- Soft-delete: `status: 0` hides a place from the list without removing Firestore data
- "+ New Place" button opens the add-place modal

### Place Detail Page (`#place/{id}`)
- Sets `window.currentPlace` on load
- **Summary line**: "X journal entries · Y activities" (loaded in parallel via `Promise.all`)
- **Interactive map**: Leaflet.js map centered on `lat`/`lng`, showing a marker. Initialized in a 50ms `setTimeout` after the container becomes visible; `map.invalidateSize()` called to handle deferred layout. Previous map instance destroyed with `_placeDetailMap.remove()` on re-visit.
- **Photos**: Full gallery via `photos.js` — `targetType: 'place'`, `targetId: place.id`. Camera and gallery upload buttons wired in `photos.js` `DOMContentLoaded`.
- **Facts**: Key/value pairs via `facts.js` — `targetType: 'place'`. "Add Fact" button wired in `facts.js` `DOMContentLoaded`.
- **Journal Entries**: Lists all journal entries with `placeIds` array containing this place's ID. Uses `array-contains` Firestore query (no composite index needed). Sorted newest-first. Check-in entries show a 📍 badge. Clicking an entry navigates to it via `openEditJournalEntry(id)`.
- **Activities**: Full activity list via `activities.js` — `targetType: 'place'`. "Log Activity" button wired in `activities.js`.

### Add / Edit Place
- Modal with fields: Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Category, Notes
- **GPS capture**: "Use My Location" button calls `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`, then reverse-geocodes via Nominatim to auto-fill Name/Address/City/State/Zip
- **Search**: Text search field queries OSM Nominatim for matching venues; results shown in dropdown; selecting auto-fills all fields including `lat`/`lng`/`osmId`

### Check-In Flow
1. User taps "📍 Check In" (QuickLog or SecondBrain)
2. **Check-in form**: Shows nearby venues (via OSM Overpass API within 500m radius) or search results
3. User selects a venue
4. Form pre-fills as a journal entry with `isCheckin: true` and the venue pre-attached
5. User edits entry text (optional) and taps Save
6. Saves a `journalEntries` doc with `placeIds: [placeId]`, `isCheckin: true`
7. If the place wasn't already in Firestore, `placesSaveNew()` creates it first (dedup by `osmId` if available)

### OSM Integration
- **Nominatim** (text search + reverse geocode): `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search` and `/reverse`
- **Overpass API** (nearby venues): Queries nodes within radius; returns name, lat, lng, address tags
- Both endpoints are free, no API key needed; rate-limited (max 1 req/sec)
- Results shown in a dropdown; user selects to populate place fields

### LLM Enrichment (`placesEnrichWithLLM()`)
- Non-blocking background enrichment after a new place is saved
- Sends place name + address to LLM and asks for category, opening hours hint, and notes
- If LLM responds, updates the Firestore doc with enriched fields
- Silent failure — no UI feedback if LLM is not configured or enrichment fails

### Deduplication
- Before creating a new place, `placesSaveNew()` checks if any existing place has the same `osmId` (if provided)
- If a match is found, returns the existing place's ID without creating a duplicate
- Places without `osmId` (manually entered) are never auto-deduped

### Firestore
- **Collection**: `places`
- **Key fields**: `name`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`, `lat`, `lng`, `osmId?`, `category?`, `notes`, `status` (1=active, 0=soft-deleted), `profilePhotoData?`, `createdAt`
- **Soft delete**: `status: 0` (never hard-deleted)
- **No `orderBy`** in queries — avoids composite index requirement; results sorted client-side

### Routes
- `#places` — places list
- `#place/{id}` — place detail

### SecondBrain Integration
- `CHECK_IN` action: short-circuit (same pattern as `FIND_THING` — no Firestore write from SecondBrain itself)
- If `payload.placeName` provided: calls `placesSearchByName()` → passes first match to `openCheckInForm(venue, false)`
- If `payload.useGps: true` or no name: calls `openCheckIn()` (GPS-based nearby venues)
- The place is not committed to Firestore until the user taps Save on the check-in form

### Life Projects (`life-projects.js`)

**Plan document**: `ModifyProjects.md`

Rich project management for the Life section — supports day-by-day itineraries, bookings, packing lists, to-dos, journal notes, people lists, and cost rollup. Template-based (Vacation is the first template; Build and General are planned).

**Firestore**:
- `lifeProjects` — `title`, `description`, `template` (vacation/build/general, locked after creation), `status` (planning/active/on-hold/done), `mode` (planning/travel), `archived`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `targetType` ('life'), `targetId` (null), `people[]` ({name, contactId, notes}), `bookingTypes[]`, `links[]` ({id, label, url}), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- Subcollections per project: `todoItems` ({text, done, notes, sortOrder}), `planningGroups` ({name, sortOrder, items[]}), `days`, `bookings`, `bookingPhotos`, `packingItems`, `projectNotes`

**Routes**: `#life-projects` (list), `#life-project/{id}` (detail)

**Project list page**: Cards showing template icon, title, date range, description, and status badge (color-coded, left-aligned below title). Archive/unarchive toggle, edit metadata, delete with cascade (all subcollections deleted). "Show archived" checkbox filters archived projects. Breadcrumb: Life › Projects.

**New project flow**: Template picker (Vacation enabled, others grayed/disabled), title, description, start/end dates. Vacation template auto-populates starter to-do items on creation.

**Import from JSON**: "📥 Import" button on the project list page. Reads a `.json` file containing project data (project doc, bookings, days with itinerary items, todoItems, packingItems, projectNotes, locations, distances, planningGroups). Import flow: (1) select JSON file, (2) people-linking step — modal walks through each person in the file, showing a contact search picker (same chip-based pattern) with "Don't Link" skip option, (3) creates project doc + all subcollections in Firestore via batch writes. Locations are deduplicated by name against existing global `locations` collection — existing records are reused, new ones are created. All locations are linked to the project via `projectLocations` subcollection. Distances are written to the global `distances` collection skipping pairs that already exist. Item `locationId` fields (JSON IDs) are mapped to real `projectLocations` doc IDs during import. Booking confirmation numbers are auto-matched to itinerary items' `bookingRef` fields. After import, navigates to the new project detail page. JSON files stored in `imports/` directory.

**JSON format** — top-level arrays: `locations[]` (id, name, address, phone, website, contact, notes), `distances[]` (fromLocationId, toLocationId, miles, time, mode, notes — IDs reference the JSON `id` field on locations), `days[]`, `planningGroups[]`, `bookings[]`, `todoItems[]`, `packingItems[]`, `projectNotes[]`. Items in `days[].items[]` and `planningGroups[].items[]` accept an optional `locationId` using the JSON location id.

**Project detail page**: Breadcrumb: Life › Projects › {title}. Scrollable accordion layout with lazy-loading sections:
- **Trip Info**: Dates, description (read-only display, edit from list page), cost rollup showing total from bookings + day item costs
- **Itinerary**: Day-by-day planning. Auto-generate days from project date range (with optional pre/post travel days). Each day has label, date, location, and embedded items array. **Day cards are individually collapsible** — clicking the day header (▾/▸ chevron + title area) toggles the items body. Collapsed days show an item count badge. Collapse state is in-memory (resets on page reload). SortableJS drag handles still work normally on expanded days. Items edited via shared modal form (all fields inline — no prompt chains): title, status (confirmed/maybe/idea/nope), time, duration, **leave by** (departure time), **"Part of official timeline"** checkbox, cost + costNote, confirmation, contact, notes, **facts** (dynamic label+value rows — URL values render as clickable links in the detail panel), location dropdown (links item to a project location), booking link dropdown, show-on-calendar checkbox, move-to dropdown (any other day or planning group). Cancel/Save buttons right-aligned. Drag-and-drop reorder for both days and items within a day (SortableJS). Expandable detail panel per item.
  - **Official Timeline**: Items marked "Part of official timeline" (`onTimeline: true`) display a left time column (blue left border) showing ⏰ start time / ⏱ duration / 🚀 leave-by time (stacked; only fields that are set). Non-timeline items show no left column. Between consecutive timeline items, a **travel row** is auto-inserted showing depart time (previous item's leave-by), travel mode icon + time + miles (from global distances collection), and route label (From → To). If no distance record exists for the pair, shows ⚠️ travel time needed as a placeholder.
  - **Journal icon on day cards**: When the itinerary loads, journal entries for the project's date range are fetched in a single query. Any day that has at least one journal entry shows a 📓 icon button in the day card header (to the right of ✏️, before ✕). Tooltip: "Journal Entries". Clicking opens the Life > Journal page in a new browser tab with the custom date range pre-set to that day's date (both start and end). The user can then adjust the range in the journal to see adjacent days.
- **Planning Board** (planning mode only): Research and brainstorming area organized by freeform groups (e.g., "Jackson area", "Old Faithful area", "Day trips"). Each group has items with the same fields as itinerary items (title, status, cost, duration, notes, facts[], contact, locationId). Items can be moved to a specific itinerary day or to a different planning group via the shared item modal. Itinerary items can likewise be moved back to a planning group. Leftover items after the trip represent things decided against. Subcollection: `planningGroups` ({name, sortOrder, items[]}). Hidden in travel mode. Drag-and-drop reorder for groups and items. **Group cards are individually collapsible** — clicking the group header toggles the items body; collapse state is in-memory.
- **Journal** (planning mode only): Journal-style entries with title, text, and auto-set createdAt. Displayed newest first. Add/edit/delete. Accordion summary shows note count. Hidden in travel mode.
- **To-Do** (planning mode only): Checklist with done toggle, notes, drag-and-drop reorder (SortableJS). Summary shows done/total count. Vacation template pre-populates 10 starter items. Hidden in travel mode.
- **Photos**: Project-level photo gallery — screenshots, inspiration images, maps, etc. not tied to a specific booking. Add via 🖼️ Gallery (file picker, supports multi-select), 📷 Camera (capture), or 📋 Paste (clipboard). After selecting, a caption modal appears (optional caption, Enter to confirm, Cancel skips the photo). Photos stored in `projectPhotos` subcollection (Base64 + caption + createdAt). Displayed as a 4-per-row thumbnail grid (square crop, object-fit cover). Clicking a thumbnail opens a **lightbox** overlay (dark backdrop) showing the full image, caption, ✏️ Edit Caption button, 🗑️ Delete button, and ✕ Close. Clicking the backdrop or pressing Escape also closes the lightbox. Caption editing uses a `prompt()` for simplicity. Visible in both planning and travel modes. Accordion summary shows photo count.
- **Links**: Project-level reference links not tied to any day or item — e.g., YouTube videos, maps, research pages saved during planning. Each link has a label and URL. Rows show: 🔗 clickable label (opens in new tab), ⧉ copy-to-clipboard button, ✏️ edit, ✕ delete. Stored as `links: [{id, label, url}]` array on the project document. Visible in both planning and travel modes.
- **Bookings**: Full CRUD with modal form. Fields: name, type (dropdown from project's bookingTypes list with "Add new..." option), start/end dates, multi-day toggle, start/end times, confirmation #, cost + costNote, payment status (paid/deposit/balance-owed), contact, address, link, notes. Booking screenshots stored in `bookingPhotos` subcollection — upload, view gallery, delete. Booking badges on day items scroll to the booking card. Drag-and-drop reorder.
- **Packing**: Items grouped by category (Clothes, Toiletries, Electronics, Documents, Gear/Other) with category headers and per-category packed counts. Vacation template offers "Populate Default List" button to pre-fill ~47 starter items. Check/uncheck packed status. Accordion summary shows "packed/total".
- **Locations** (planning mode only, icon 📌): List of real-world places linked to this project. Each row shows name and address. Row buttons: Edit (opens modal), Unlink (removes from project, keeps global record), Delete (removes global record — confirm first). **Add Location modal**: search field filters existing global locations by name — selecting one links it to the project; "New location" section below (always visible) has fields: Name, Address, Phone, Website, Contact, Notes, plus an "Add to Planning Board" checkbox that auto-creates a planning item with this location linked. Locations stored in user-scoped global collection `userCol('locations')`; project membership tracked in `projectLocations` subcollection (locationId + cached name/address/phone). Hidden in travel mode.
- **Distances** (planning mode only, icon 🛣️): Reference list of travel distances between project locations. Shown as **From → To | Time | Miles | Mode** with ✏️ Edit and ✕ Delete per row. No standalone Add button — distances are created from the 🛣️ button on a planning or itinerary item (item must have a location set; From is pre-filled from that location). **Add/Edit Distance modal**: From (read-only label), To dropdown (project locations excluding From), Time (text, e.g. "51 min"), Miles (number), Mode (Drive/Walk/Bike/Fly), Notes, Ask AI button. Requires at least Time or Miles. Distances stored in user-scoped global collection `userCol('distances')` with `fromLocationId`/`toLocationId` referencing global location doc IDs. Accordion shows a helper message when fewer than 2 locations are linked to the project. Hidden in travel mode.
- **People**: Chip-based contact picker (same pattern as Life Calendar events). Type partial name, dropdown filters contacts, Enter selects first match. Selected people shown as blue chips with ✕ remove button and clickable name linking to contact detail. Edit button allows adding notes. Stored as array on project doc ({name, contactId, notes}).

**Item row buttons** (planning board and itinerary, planning mode only): Clicking the **item title** expands/collapses the detail panel (no separate expand icon). On desktop the collapsed row shows: status badge, title, booking badge, location badge (📍 name), ✏️ edit button, and 📍/🛣️ location button. On **mobile (≤640px)** the collapsed row shows only the title — status badge, location badge, booking badge, ✏️ edit, and 📍/🛣️ are hidden and instead appear at the top of the **expanded detail panel** (badges on one line, buttons on the next line), keeping the collapsed row clean. Delete lives inside the edit modal only. CSS utility classes `.lp-desktop-only` / `.lp-mobile-only` control visibility. Expanded detail panel shows location as its own row (name · clickable address → Google Maps · clickable phone → tel:).

**Planning/Travel mode toggle**: Button in project header switches mode (stored on project doc). Travel mode hides maybe/idea/nope items, hides cost fields, hides To-Do, Locations, and Notes sections, auto-expands Itinerary and Bookings, and makes confirmed items more prominent.

**Search**: Text input at the top of the detail page filters visible content across all accordion sections — day cards, booking cards, to-do items, packing items, and notes. Hides non-matching elements in real time.

**Delete cascade**: Removes all subcollection docs (days, bookings, bookingPhotos, todoItems, packingItems, projectNotes, planningGroups, projectLocations) before deleting the project doc.

## Part 11: Shared Features

These features are used across multiple sections. The implementation lives primarily in dedicated JS files.

### Photos (`photos.js`)

**Firestore**: `photos` — `targetType`, `targetId`, `imageData` (Base64 JPEG), `caption`, `takenAt`, `createdAt`

**Key fields**:
- `targetType`: identifies the entity type (e.g., `plant`, `zone`, `thing`, `subthing`, `item`, `collectionitem`, `person`, `vehicle`, `weed`, `chemical`, `place`, etc.)
- `targetId`: Firestore document ID of the entity

**Storage**: Base64 JPEG compressed client-side using the Canvas API. Target size ~100–200KB per photo.

**Gallery UI**:
- Shows newest photo by default
- Newer / Older navigation buttons with counter (e.g., "2 of 5")
- Caption shown below photo (edit caption or add caption button)
- Action buttons per photo: **⭐ Use as Profile/Thumbnail** (supported types only), **🔍 View**, **Edit/Add Caption**, **Delete Photo**

**Photo upload paths**:
- Camera input (`<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture>`)
- Gallery picker (`<input type="file" accept="image/*">`)
- Clipboard paste
- LLM identification flow (photos staged and compressed before sending)

**Crop tool**: Cropper.js instance shown before save — user can adjust framing. Optional, can skip. Also accessible from the View lightbox (see below).

**View Lightbox** (`openPhotoLightbox()` in `photos.js`):
- Tapping **🔍 View** opens a full-screen dark overlay (z-index 9999)
- **Pinch-to-zoom**: 2-finger pinch gesture scales the image from 1× up to 5×
- **Pan**: 1-finger drag pans the image when zoomed in (no-op at 1×)
- **Long-press download**: Hold finger on the image for ~650ms to trigger a download of the photo as `photo.jpg`
- **✂ Crop button**: shown at the bottom — closes lightbox and opens the Cropper.js flow
- **✕ close button**: top-right corner dismisses the overlay
- Implemented as a dynamically-created DOM element appended to `document.body` (no static modal in `index.html`)

**Profile / Thumbnail photos**:
- Supported entity types: `plant`, `weed`, `person`, `vehicle`, `thing`, `subthing`, `item`, `collectionitem`
- Stored as `profilePhotoData` directly on the entity document (compressed further to ~300px max dimension)
- **Auto-set**: When the first photo is added to a supported entity (via LLM flow or manual add), `profilePhotoData` is auto-set from that first photo
- **Manual override**: "⭐ Use as Profile" (or "⭐ Use as Thumbnail" for collection items) button in the gallery sets any photo as the thumbnail
- **Live update**: Setting a thumbnail updates the in-memory `window.current*` state object so the UI reflects the change without a full page reload

**Key maps in `photos.js`**:
```js
// Which entity types support profile/thumbnail photos
var PROFILE_PHOTO_TYPES = ['plant', 'weed', 'person', 'vehicle', 'thing', 'subthing', 'item', 'collectionitem'];

// Maps targetType → Firestore collection for writing profilePhotoData
var PROFILE_COLLECTION_MAP = {
    plant:          'plants',
    weed:           'weeds',
    person:         'people',
    vehicle:        'vehicles',
    thing:          'things',
    subthing:       'subThings',
    item:           'subThingItems',
    collectionitem: 'collectionItems',
};

// Maps targetType → [containerId, emptyStateId] for the gallery container
var PHOTO_CONTAINERS = { /* ... all entity types ... */ };
```

### Facts (`facts.js`)

**Firestore**: `facts` — `targetType`, `targetId`, `label`, `value`, `createdAt`

**UI**: Displayed as a table of label/value pairs. Add and edit via a modal. Delete with confirmation.

**URL values**: If `value` starts with `http`, it renders as a clickable `<a href="..." target="_blank">` link.

**Used by**: Zones, plants, weeds, chemicals, vehicles, people, all house/garage/structure entities, health entities

### Activities (`activities.js`)

**Firestore**:
- `activities` — `targetType`, `targetId`, `description`, `notes`, `date`, `chemicalIds[]`, `savedActionId?`, `placeId?`, `createdAt`
- `savedActions` — `name`, `description`, `chemicalIds[]`, `notes`, `createdAt`

**Log activity modal**:
- Date picker (defaults to today)
- Description text (pre-filled if saved action selected)
- Notes textarea
- Chemical multi-select: checkbox list of all chemicals, supports selecting multiple
- "Use Saved Action" dropdown: pre-fills description and chemical selection
- **Place (optional)**: Search field to attach a place to the activity. Typing opens a dropdown of matching places (via Nominatim + saved places). Selecting shows a chip with a clear button. If the place doesn't exist in Firestore yet, it is auto-created via `placesSaveNew()` when the activity is saved. Saved place name shown as a tappable link in the activity list row.

**Activity list**: Compact rows with date + description + Edit button. Edit modal shows full details (read-only) plus Save as Action and Delete.

**Saved Actions**: Reusable templates. Created from an existing activity ("Save as Action" button) or from the Saved Actions management page (`#actions`). Used across any entity type.

**Used by**: All entity types (yard zones/plants/weeds, house things, vehicles, people, etc.)

### Problems / Concerns (`problems.js`)

**Firestore**: `problems` — `targetType`, `targetId`, `description`, `notes`, `status` (open/resolved), `dateLogged`, `resolvedAt`, `createdAt`

**UI**: List of problems per entity. Each shows description, date logged, and status badge. Click to expand for notes and full detail.

**Status toggle**: Mark as resolved → sets `resolvedAt` timestamp and status to "resolved". Can be re-opened.

**Show resolved**: Checkbox to toggle visibility of past-resolved problems.

**Roll-up**: Parent entities (floors, rooms, things) aggregate all descendant problems (e.g., a floor's problem list includes all problems from rooms and things in that floor). Source label shown (e.g., "from: Kitchen").

**Facts on problems**: Each problem can have its own facts (key/value pairs).

**Add/Edit modal**: Save and Cancel buttons appear both at the top (inline with the title) and at the bottom, so the user can save without scrolling regardless of keyboard position.

**Fields**: "Title" (short name, text input) and "Description" (free-form details, textarea). Stored as `description` and `notes` in Firestore respectively.

**Voice-to-text**: The Description textarea has a 🎤 Speak button for hands-free dictation in the field.

**Photos on problems**: Each problem can have photos attached (Camera, Gallery, or Paste). `targetType: 'problem'`, `targetId: problem.id`. In add mode, the problem is auto-saved first to get an ID before photos can be attached.

**Used by**: All entity types

### Quick Task List (`projects.js`)

Formerly named "Future Projects" — renamed to "Quick Task List" to distinguish from the new Life Projects system.

**Firestore**: `projects` — `targetType`, `targetId`, `title`, `notes`, `status` (active/completed), `items[]` (array of `{text, done, completedAt, notes}`), `completedAt`, `createdAt`

**UI**: Collapsible cards — collapsed shows title + item count badge; expanded shows full checklist.

**Checklist items**: Click item to toggle done. Completion timestamp recorded per item. Notes can be added to individual items.

**Project completion**: Mark entire project as complete → sets `completedAt`.

**Show completed**: Checkbox to toggle visibility of completed projects.

**Roll-up**: Same pattern as Problems — parent entities aggregate all descendant projects.

**Add/Edit modal**: Save and Cancel buttons appear both at the top (inline with the title) and at the bottom, so the user can save without scrolling regardless of keyboard position.

**Voice-to-text**: The Notes textarea has a 🎤 Speak button for hands-free dictation.

**Used by**: All entity types

### Calendar Events (`calendar.js`)

**Firestore**: `calendarEvents` — `title`, `description`, `date` (ISO string), `recurring` (null or `{type, intervalDays}`), `targetType?`, `targetId?`, `zoneIds[]`, `savedActionId?`, `completed`, `completedDates[]`, `cancelledDates[]`, `createdAt`

**Recurring types**: `weekly` (+7 days), `monthly` (same day next month, clamped to month-end), `every_x_days` (user-specified interval)

**Display range**: Configurable 1/3/6/12 months. Default is 3 months. Events shown chronologically, grouped by month with headers.

**Complete event flow**:
1. Click "Complete" on an event occurrence
2. Optional notes modal
3. Creates an Activity record on the linked entity (if `targetType`/`targetId` set)
4. Marks the occurrence as completed (`completed = true` for one-time, adds date to `completedDates[]` for recurring)

**Overdue section**: Past-due uncompleted events shown at the top with orange "OVERDUE" badge. This applies both to the main calendar page (`loadOverdueEvents()`) and to every entity detail page calendar section (`loadEventsForTarget()`). On entity pages, overdue cards appear above the upcoming list so missed events (e.g. a recurring maintenance reminder) are never silently dropped — they stay visible until completed.

**Delete recurring**: Shows warning that ALL occurrences will be removed.

**Copy event**: Creates a new one-time event pre-filled with the source event's title and description (date cleared).

**Multi-zone**: Events can be linked to multiple zones via `zoneIds[]`.

**Entity-linked events**: Events on zone/plant/vehicle/house entity detail pages show only events for that entity. When opening the Add Event modal from any non-yard entity page (plant, thing, subthing, item, floor, room, structure, structurething, structuresubthing, vehicle, garageroom, garagething, garagesubthing), the zone picker is hidden and no zone selection is required — the linked entity IS the location context. Zone selection is only required for standalone calendar events or events opened from a yard zone/weed page. The modal header shows "Adding event for: [entity name]" when opened from an entity page. Edit modal likewise hides the zone picker for existing entity-linked events and shows "Linked to: [entity name]".

**Used by**: All sections (yard, house, garage, vehicles, life, structures)

### GPS / Location (`gps.js`, `BishopGps.md`)
- Zones can be assigned GPS coordinates
- `#yardmap`: shows all zones with coordinates on an interactive map
- `#gpsmap/{id}`: shows a single zone's location
- Map library: Leaflet.js (free, open-source)

### Search (`search.js`)
- **Route**: `#search`
- Global full-text search across zones, plants, weeds, chemicals, vehicles, people, notes, and more
- Result cards show entity type, name, key details
- Clicking a result navigates to the entity detail page

### Checklists (`checklists.js`)
- **Route**: `#checklists` — shared page; retains the nav context active when the link was clicked
- Accessible from Yard, House, and Life nav bars
- **Context-aware**: shows only templates and runs relevant to the current location
- **Context detection**: `app.js` sets `window.clLastEntityType` ('zone', 'floor', 'room', 'vehicle', or null) on every page route, and `clCaptureContext()` reads it + entity globals to determine the active context before navigating to checklists
- **Roll-up rule**: a child entity's checklists appear on the parent page (e.g., zone checklists appear on the Yard page), but a parent's checklists do NOT appear on child pages
- **Contexts and roll-up behaviour**:
  - Yard: shows all yard-general + all zone templates/runs
  - Zone: shows that zone + all its descendant zones
  - House: shows all house-general + all floors + all rooms
  - Floor: shows that floor + all rooms on that floor
  - Room: shows that room only
  - Vehicle: shows that vehicle only
  - Life: shows all life-tagged templates/runs (no sub-targets)
- **Templates** (`checklistTemplates`): `{ name, targetType, targetId, targetName, items:[{label}], createdAt }`
  - `targetType`: 'yard' | 'zone' | 'house' | 'floor' | 'room' | 'vehicle' | 'life'
  - `targetId`: Firestore ID of the entity, or null for top-level targets (yard/house/life)
  - `targetName`: human-readable label stored at save time (e.g., "Front Yard", "Kitchen")
- **Runs** (`checklistRuns`): same `targetType`/`targetId`/`targetName` fields, copied from template at start time; `items` array is `[{label, done, note}]`
- **Template modal**: Location dropdown shows the full hierarchy for the current context (e.g., Yard → zones → subzones), defaulting to the entity the user was on when they clicked Checklists; full hierarchy shown so user can pick any level. Delete button is inside the edit modal.
- **Location badge**: shown on template/run cards in roll-up views (e.g., "📍 Front Yard")
- **Context subtitle**: shown on the page header ("Showing: Front Yard (Zone)")
- **Active run cards**:
  - Progress bar shows done/total count
  - **Edit mode**: toggled by an Edit/Done button on the card. In edit mode: ✕ remove buttons appear beside each item; a "+ Add item" input row appears at the bottom. Removing items never prompts to modify the template.
  - **Adding items in edit mode**: if the run is derived from a template, user is prompted "Add to template too?" Adding items to a blank list never prompts.
  - **Clear All button**: unchecks all items in-place without confirmation
  - **Mark Complete**: moves run to the Completed section
  - **Abandon button**: deletes the run after confirmation
- **Per-item notes**: each item has a 📝 button that toggles an inline textarea. Note saves on blur or Enter. Escape discards changes. Note is displayed in muted italic below the item label when set.
- **Item completion date**: checking an item records a `doneAt` ISO timestamp. The date is displayed inline next to the strikethrough label as `(Apr 17)` in muted italic. Unchecking clears `doneAt`. Stored in `items[].doneAt`.
- **Item sort order**: undone items appear first (in their original order); done items sort to the bottom in the order they were completed (earliest first). Sort is display-only — storage order is preserved so indices remain stable for all Firestore operations.
- **Blank lists**: "+ New Blank List" button in the Active section header creates a run with no template. Prompts for a name; inherits target context from the current page.
- **Completed run accordion**: clicking a completed card expands/collapses a read-only item list (✓ done / ✗ missed). Notes are shown read-only below each item in the expanded view.

## Part 12: Navigation & Routing

The app has three navigation contexts, each with its own nav bar:

| Context | Nav Items |
|---------|-----------|
| **Yard** | Zones, Calendar, History, Checklists, Structures, Search, Chat |
| **House** | House (floors), Rooms, Calendar, Checklists, Yard, Things, Collections, Search, Chat |
| **Life** | Journal, Contacts, Notes, Checklists, Chat |

**Shared pages** (retain last active context): Settings, Change Password, GPS Map, Checklists

**Mobile nav**: Hamburger menu that toggles a full-screen overlay. Desktop nav: horizontal bar.

**Breadcrumb bar**: Sticky header below the nav bar showing the current hierarchy (e.g., "House › 1st Floor › Kitchen"). Built dynamically on each page load into `document.getElementById('breadcrumbBar')`.

**Context switching**: Tapping "My House" logo navigates to `#home` and sets yard context. Separate nav items switch between House and Life contexts.

## Part 13: Testing

### Test Account
The app requires Firebase Auth login. A shared test account is used for local preview server testing:

- **Email**: `skasputi@pattersoncompanies.com`
- **Password**: `steve2a2`
- **Server**: `http://localhost:8080` (Python HTTP server, port 8080)

Credentials are stored locally in `.test-credentials.md` (gitignored — never committed to the repo).

### Dev Server
The dev server is a Python HTTP server configured in `.claude/launch.json`:
- **Name**: `bishop-dev`
- **Port**: 8080
- Launch via Claude Code preview tools (`preview_start` with name `bishop-dev`)

### Test Plans
Feature-specific test plans live in their own markdown files:
- `LifeCalendar.md` — includes a detailed test matrix (T-1 through T-16, all passing)

### General Test Approach
1. Start the dev server (`preview_start` → `bishop-dev`)
2. Log in with test account credentials
3. Navigate to the feature being tested
4. Verify: create, edit, delete, field validation, and any feature-specific flows
5. Verify mobile layout at 375px viewport width
6. Check browser console for JS errors (`preview_console_logs` with `level: error`)

### Known Test Gotchas
- `alert()` calls (e.g., on the event form dirty-check) will freeze `preview_eval` for 30 seconds — navigate to a fresh page before running evals that might trigger alerts
- After `closeModal()`, navigation must use `setTimeout(..., 50)` — test that back-button behavior is correct after modal interactions
- Duplicate event listeners accumulate on buttons if `cloneNode` is not used — test that clicking modal buttons multiple times doesn't fire handlers multiple times
- Cache busting: if a fix isn't appearing, verify the `?v=N` was bumped on all script and CSS tags
- **Empty test account**: The test account may have no data. For UI-only verifications (e.g., checking a button label or that a modal opens), inject mock state via `preview_eval` rather than concluding the feature is untestable

### Keeping This Spec Current
- The functional spec must be updated in the **same commit** as any feature change
- Do not defer spec updates — a stale spec gives the wrong context at the start of the next session
- Update the section that owns the changed feature; add new sections for new entity types or major new capabilities
- **Always tell the user** when the spec was updated — state which section(s) changed and what was added/modified. This allows the user to notice if a spec update was skipped when it should have happened.

## Part 14: Deployment

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages — live at `https://dolphinstevekasputis.github.io/BishopHome`
- **GitHub username**: `DolphinSteveKasputis`
- **Branch**: `main` (deployed automatically from main branch)
- **Push protocol**: Always send the ntfy.sh notification before `git push` — Windows requires a credential confirmation prompt:
  ```
  curl -d "Ready to push — please confirm the Windows prompt" ntfy.sh/WolfLifeBishop
  ```
- **Notifications**: Task completion notifications sent to `ntfy.sh/WolfLifeBishop`

**Firestore**: `db.collection('sharedDevNotes')` — **not** per-user; all users share the same collection.

Simple shared scratchpad accessible from Settings → Dev Notes. All logged-in users can read, add, edit, and delete notes.

- Each note has: `text`, `author` (email of the user who created it), `createdAt`
- Notes display newest-first with date + author shown on each card
- Edit preserves the original author (does not overwrite with editor's identity)
- SecondBrain `ADD_DEV_NOTE` action also writes to this shared collection and navigates to `#devnotes`
